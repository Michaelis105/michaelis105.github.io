My first personal professional website showcases my skills, expertise, and portfolio in a light-hearted manner. I've always wanted to make a site like this for two reasons: 

1) Introduce another way to show the world what I am 
2) Build some web development skills using the latest and greatest adaptive design.

History
Okay I lied this wasn't actually my first website. If you don't care about the history, skip to the next section.

A long time ago in high school I saw this amazing site using pretty cool layouts and design. If you just thought Bootstrap, then you are correct. Really old but still appealing. So I wanted to make something like it but it turned out really UGLY. So then I gave up :( .

Fast-forward sevenish years later and now I have more confidence in my programming ability having earned a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science. Web technology has really advanced ever since then so I decided tried again. This time it was a success and I am happy :).

On making the site
If you like my site and want to follow along with its 'blueprints', you should know basic HTML5, CSS, and a good sense of intuitive user experience. It took me about 10-15ish working hours to get to what you see. Here is how I did it.

1) Go to http://mdbootstrap.com/ and download the Material Design Bootstrap CDN version. Simply put, you cannot upload its source code to the public (such as GitHub).

2) Plan your website design on paper and pen first. It makes things easier in the end, trust me.

3.1) Go to the "Freebies" section and choose a template that look appealing to you. Copy-paste the code corresponding to your desired template. You might feel like you are cheating with the copy-pasting but you should challenge yourself to add and tweak the template far from its original. The template alone can be a bit...eh...

3.2) If you like the parallax effect on my site, then you should adapt components of this template accordingly: http://mdbootstrap.com/live/_MDB4/docs/parallax.html

4) Click on the CSS, Components, and JavaScript links to explore different cool snippets you can use for your website. Note: Some of them are for premium only.

5) Use your imagination to create the rest of your site. If it is for professional/showcase purposes, feel free to use mine as an example. 

From here
If you are somewhat new to web development (like me), then you should explore other UI frameworks and possibly venture into some JavaScript and Angular. Heck, make your own framework. Learning how to use frameworks like MDB, Angular Material, and such is like learning a new language and gives you much needed exposure to various web technologies.
